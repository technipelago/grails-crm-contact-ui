The {gr8crm} "Ecosystem" currently contains over 40 Grails plugins. For a complete list of plugins see http://gr8crm.github.io.

Each {gr8crm} plugin defines a http://martinfowler.com/bliki/BoundedContext.html[Bounded Context]
that focus on one specific domain, for example *contact*, *project* or *document*.

== Contact Management User Interface Plugin

The +crm-contact-lite+ plugin is a companion plugin to the +crm-contact+ plugin. It provides user interfaces for managing
companies, people and relationships between them. You can use it as a simple address book or as the base of a complex
customer relationship management system. The plugin is generic but flexible, it has proven support for many different use-cases.

=== Search Contacts

To query for contacts you visit +crmContact/index+ which will show the query form.

You can enter query values in any field and then hit the +Search+ button to search for contacts matching your query.
If you don't enter any query value all contacts will be included in the search result.

If the query result contains more than one contact, a contact list will be displayed. If the query result contains
exactly one contact, then details for that contact will be displayed.
I.e. it will skip the +list+ view and go directly to the +show+ view.

You can click on any contact to show details for that contact.

=== Contact Details

The contact details page +crmContact/show+ shows all the details for a selected contact.
Here you will find contact name, address and telefon numbers.

If the +crm-tags+ plugin is installed you can see existing tags and add new tags to a contact.

=== Edit Contact Details

To edit contact details you hit the +Edit+ button. This will display the edit page +crmContact/edit+.
Here you can alter values and then hit +Save+ to store the new values in the database.

=== vCard as QRCode

A nice feature in the +crmContact/show+ page is the possibility to show contact details in vCard/QRCode format.
The +View+ button has a sub menu called *Show vCard*. This option will open a modal frame that displays contact
information in a QRCode image. This image can be scanned with a smartphone and imported to the telephone's address book
just by holding the telephone in front of the computer screen.

A simple but powerful address book integration!

[NOTE]
====
iOS does not have built-in support for scanning QRCode images, but you can download scanner apps from App Store.
